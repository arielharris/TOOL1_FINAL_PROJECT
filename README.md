# Global Land Temperature Analysis - Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
Working in a jupyter notebook, we will be investigating a dataset of global temperatures taken in major cities every month from late 1800s to 2013. This investigation will involve cleaning and formating the data, decomposing and visualization, as well as forecasting. The goal of this investigation will be to use time series analysis to better understand trends presented in the data as well as use forecasting to see if we can potentially predict temperature data.
